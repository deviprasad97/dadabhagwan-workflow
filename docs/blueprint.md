# **App Name**: FormFlow Kanban

## Core Features:

- Kanban Board Display: Display Google Form submissions on a Kanban board with columns: 'Online Submitted', 'Translate Gujarati', 'Checking Gujarati', 'Print', and 'Done'.
- Drag and Drop: Enable drag-and-drop functionality to move cards between columns.
- AI Translation Suggestion: Use AI to automatically suggest a translation into Gujarati from English based on the Google Form content, providing a tool for translators to review.
- User Authentication: Implement Google Sign-In for user authentication.
- Form data parsing: Parse data submitted in the forms and render them into clear, distinct 'cards' for processing

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke a sense of calm efficiency, referencing the methodical nature of form processing. A more saturated blue would not suit our target demographic as well, and might make the application tiring to use.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, to provide a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A soft lavender (#B39DDB) to highlight interactive elements and column headers, while remaining analogous to blue.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern feel, well-suited for column titles and card headings. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for form text.
- Responsive layout to ensure usability on desktop and tablet devices. Kanban board should reflow for smaller screens.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent the different stages of the form processing workflow.
